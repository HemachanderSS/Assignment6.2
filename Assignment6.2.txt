1.MapReduce program is needed in Pig Programming:
	*In pig the queries are converted into map reduce programs as hadoop is a java based
system and understand only java based map reduce programs.
	*It has ability to perform computations in pig which cannot be done in mapreduce.
	

2.Advantages of Pig over MapReduce:
	*It laids a way for non java programmers to get a chance on work in data analytics
based projects.
	*Decrease in development time whereas in mapreduce jobs are complexity, more time 
spent and needed maintenance of the programs.
	*It uses all the hadoop offers like parellelization, fault-tolerancy and many 
relational database features.
	*It is tool process the large unstructured data to structured data.
	*It doesn't need to import any library packages.
	*Ir is a procedural approach, so we can control the execution of every step.
	


3.Pig Engine:
	Apache Pig has a component known as pig engine which accepts the pig latin scripts
and converts those scripts into mapreduce jobs.

*Importance:
	*It acts as an interpreter between the pig latin script and mapreduce jobs.
	*It creates environment to execute pig scripts into series of mapreduce jobs in 
parallel manner.


4.Modes of pig execution:
	2 modes of pig execution are
	
	1.Local mode:
		In this mode, you can run the pig to access to a single machine where all
the files are stored in local file system.
	2.MapReduce mode:
		In this mode, you can run the pig to access to a hadoop cluster and hdfs 
installation.


5.Grunt shell in pig:
	*It is an interactive shell for executing pig commands.
	*It is used when scripts file is not provided.
	*It can execute scripts from Grunt via run or exec commands.

6.Features of pig latin language:
	*It provides many operations to perform operations such as join, sort, filter etc.
	*It is similar to SQL and it is easy to write Pig Script if you have good knowledge
in SQL.
	*The tasks in Apache Pig optimize their execution automatically.
	*Using the existing operators users can develop their own functions.
	*It provides the facility to create user-defined functions in other programming 
languages such as Java and invoke then in pig scripts.


7. Is Pig Latin commands case sensitive:
	*The names of relations and fields are case sensitive.
	*The names of the pig latin functions are also case sensitive.
	*The names of parameters and all other pig latin keywords are case insensitive.

8. Data flow language:
	*A data flow language is one which can be represented as a directed graph with a
specific flow of data through the programme following the data flow priniciples and 
architecture rules laid on them.
